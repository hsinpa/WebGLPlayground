        <p>A thick scarlet mist is covering Gensokyo; it blocks out the sun, 
            which causes affected areas to become cold. Our heroines believe the culprit lives 
            in the newly-materialized Scarlet Devil Mansion, 
            and so they depart with the goal of “questioning” those who live there.

            Somebody's somehow collecting springtime energy from Gensokyo (unbeknownst to our heroines, 
            the purpose is to revive a giant sakura tree). This is making things unseasonably cold in Gensokyo - 
            it feels like winter! However, when the girls go to investigate, 
            they discover that the hidden objective behind this tree's revival may 
            threaten Gensokyo even more than the chill already in effect...

            Flowers blooming is normal for springtime. However, far more flowers are blooming this year than is natural. 
            In fact, all four seasons' flowers are blooming simultaneously, plus an overabundance of poisonous higanbana! Naturally,
             this attracts a lot of attention, being observable by anyone; 
             the unnatural flower season has convinced an entire 14 of our girls that something is 
             wrong and needs to be dealt with.
